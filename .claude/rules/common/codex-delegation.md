# Codex Delegation Rules

Codex is the technical lead for repository exploration, design, implementation, debugging, tests, and independent review. Claude owns the task brief, risk tier, approval gates, and final acceptance.

## Canonical Contract

Use `.claude/docs/CODEX_TASK_CONTRACT.md` for the task schema, risk tiers, phase outputs, and runner usage. Do not duplicate large prompts in skills or hooks.

## Workflow

1. Claude creates `.claude/tasks/<task-id>/brief.md` with objective, scope, non-goals, acceptance criteria, risk tier, required validation, forbidden actions, and blockers.
2. T1 may run one implementation phase directly when the brief justifies low localized risk.
3. T2 and T3 require `plan.md`, Claude `approval.md`, implementation, independent review, then Claude acceptance.
4. T3 additionally requires explicit user approval before implementation or any external action.

## Runner

```bash
python3 .claude/scripts/codex_handoff.py plan <task-id>
python3 .claude/scripts/codex_handoff.py implement <task-id>
python3 .claude/scripts/codex_handoff.py review <task-id>
python3 .claude/scripts/codex_handoff.py status <task-id>
python3 .claude/scripts/codex_handoff.py collect <task-id>
python3 .claude/scripts/codex_handoff.py cancel <task-id>
```

The runner passes prompts through stdin, uses strict config, isolates phases with ephemeral invocations, uses read-only sandboxing for plan/review, uses workspace-write for implementation, writes `plan.md`, the `implementation-result` Markdown artifact, `review.md`, `state.json`, and an append-only `codex-events.jsonl`, and fails closed on missing prerequisites, empty output, Codex failure, task path traversal, or declared network requirements.

Phase commands accept `--model` and `--effort`. Model precedence is CLI `--model`, phase env (`CODEX_PLAN_MODEL`, `CODEX_IMPLEMENT_MODEL`, `CODEX_REVIEW_MODEL`), general env `CODEX_MODEL`, optional T0 read-only env `CODEX_FAST_MODEL`, then omitted model flag. Effort precedence is CLI `--effort`, phase env (`CODEX_PLAN_EFFORT`, `CODEX_IMPLEMENT_EFFORT`, `CODEX_REVIEW_EFFORT`), general env `CODEX_EFFORT`, then the default effort matrix from the task risk tier. The runner records the source in `state.json` and `codex-events.jsonl`.

Run `implement` and `review` through Claude Code background Bash execution when long-running work should continue asynchronously. The runner itself does not daemonize, detach, kill processes, or manage background PIDs. `status` and `collect` are read-only; `cancel` only marks `state.json` as cancelled.

## Failure Handling

If Codex fails, do not silently continue. Report:

- Phase and task ID
- Exit status or runner error
- Missing prerequisite or validation gap
- Whether the task is `BLOCKED`, needs a revised brief, or needs explicit user approval

Acceptance criteria may not be relaxed without updating the brief and getting PM approval.
