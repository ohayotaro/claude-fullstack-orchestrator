# Codex Delegation Rules

Codex is the technical lead for repository exploration, design, implementation, debugging, tests, and independent review. Claude owns the task brief, risk tier, approval gates, and final acceptance.

## Canonical Contract

Use `.claude/docs/CODEX_TASK_CONTRACT.md` for the task schema, risk tiers, phase outputs, and runner usage. Do not duplicate large prompts in skills or hooks.

## Workflow

1. Claude creates `.claude/tasks/<task-id>/brief.md` with objective, scope, non-goals, acceptance criteria, risk tier, required validation, forbidden actions, and blockers.
2. T1 may run one implementation phase directly when the brief justifies low localized risk.
3. T2 and T3 require `plan.md`, Claude `approval.md`, implementation, independent review, then Claude acceptance.
4. T3 additionally requires explicit user approval before implementation or any external action.

## Runner

```bash
python3 .claude/scripts/codex_handoff.py plan <task-id>
python3 .claude/scripts/codex_handoff.py implement <task-id>
python3 .claude/scripts/codex_handoff.py review <task-id>
python3 .claude/scripts/codex_handoff.py status <task-id>
python3 .claude/scripts/codex_handoff.py collect <task-id>
python3 .claude/scripts/codex_handoff.py cancel <task-id>
```

The runner passes prompts through stdin, uses strict config, isolates phases with ephemeral invocations, uses read-only sandboxing for plan/review, uses workspace-write for implementation, writes `plan.md`, the `implementation-result` Markdown artifact, `review.md`, `state.json`, and an append-only `codex-events.jsonl`, and fails closed on missing prerequisites, empty output, Codex failure, task path traversal, or declared network requirements.

Phase commands accept `--model` and `--effort`. CLI values override phase env vars (`CODEX_PLAN_MODEL`, `CODEX_PLAN_EFFORT`, `CODEX_IMPLEMENT_MODEL`, `CODEX_IMPLEMENT_EFFORT`, `CODEX_REVIEW_MODEL`, `CODEX_REVIEW_EFFORT`), which override general env vars (`CODEX_MODEL`, `CODEX_EFFORT`). If no model is set, the runner omits the model flag. If no effort is set, the runner applies the default effort matrix from the task risk tier and records the source in `state.json` and `codex-events.jsonl`.

Run `implement` and `review` through Claude Code background Bash execution when long-running work should continue asynchronously. The runner itself does not daemonize, detach, kill processes, or manage background PIDs. `status` and `collect` are read-only; `cancel` only marks `state.json` as cancelled.

## Failure Handling

If Codex fails, do not silently continue. Report:

- Phase and task ID
- Exit status or runner error
- Missing prerequisite or validation gap
- Whether the task is `BLOCKED`, needs a revised brief, or needs explicit user approval

Acceptance criteria may not be relaxed without updating the brief and getting PM approval.
